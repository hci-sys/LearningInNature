# Initial Paper Prototype

## Overview

![Prototype Overview](/img/prototype_overview.jpeg)

Our mobile app will start with an opening screen asking them to log/sign in to their accounts. This will allow us to authenticate our users. It will also allow our users to create accounts for features we plan to implement in the future. After logging in, the user will be brought to the home screen that gives them a list of hikes. There are images for each hike as well as short details and information about the hike. There is also a search bar for users to find hikes. The many ways to find hikes on the home screen allows users to begin the trail navigation task. The icons at the bottom of the screen also allow users to switch to identification mode. This mode can be accessed and navigation can be returned to at any time.

## Task One: Navigation

![First Task](/img/navigation.jpeg)

When they select the hike that they want to go on, they will see a screen giving the summary of the hike. This includes the distance of the hike, the difficulty of the hike and the average time that the hike will take. After clicking the start button, it takes the user to the navigation screen where they can see the map and directions of where to go. The navigation gives the user a detailed scene of the environment they are currently in such as showing tree, water and rivers around them. It navigates the user safely to their destination.

## Task Two: Identification

![Second Task](/img/identification.jpeg)

When the user taps on the identification button it takes them to the camera page. Here, it allows them to scan their surrounds for wildlife to identify. The camera covers the whole screen so it allows them to get full flexibility when it comes to navigating and really getting the depth of their surroundings. After a picture is taken and the wildlife is identified, a details page comes up. This includes a picture, the name and a description of what is being identified.

# Testing Process

### Summary

The participant for our usability test was a sophomore attending Williams College. We chose this participant because she is enthusiastic about hiking and enjoy going on a weekly trip around the beautiful purple valley. With this knowledge, the team figured she would be the perfect candidate to test out our app and to see if our prototype design was somewhat feasible. We conducted our usability test in Eco Cafe, where its central and quiet during after- hours. This allowed us and our participant to focus on the task at hand and provide a space to free the mind and provide a clear discussion. During the usability test, Gaurnett was the main one communicating with our user. Eric acted as the \"computer\". Rudy assisted with making notes about what happened during the test such as the user feedback and questions during the test, flaws in the design that led to the user performing the wrong action thus not receiving her desired result and improvements we can make based on the interaction between Gaurnett and the user.
 
We introduced the project by giving a synopsis of the problem that we are trying to solve as well as who we are trying to serve. This allowed us to give a general overview of the project and give the participant an idea of what we are trying to do. Afterwards we explained the tasks one by one that we would like her to perform. We then observed her as she went through the app and then made notes on issues that came up. One issue was that we did not have a sign up button on the login screen. Another issue we had was when she tried to identify the plant. She tapped the focal box to take the picture instead of tapping the “Identify This” button.

### Summary

The participant for our second usability test was a junior attending Williams College. As we indicated in our future plans from the usability test check-in, for this test and the third test, we tried to emphasize diversity in the experience levels of the students that we had perform the test. Thus, this student was one who had minimal experience with hiking, but enjoyed the idea of walking around in nature. We thought that through bringing in the experience of a user like this, we might be able to see if our design was simple and informative enough to be beneficial to a beginner user rather than confusing. Like the last test, this one was conducted in Eco Café at night as the location was quiet which allowed everyone to focus on the task. For this test, Rudy was the main person interacting with the user while Gaurnett played the part of the computer and Eric took notes.
 
The general process of the test was the same as for the first usability test with us starting by explaining the purpose of the test and the two tasks we wanted the user to perform. The tasks that we gave the user for this test were a bit more specific in that we asked the user to pick the shortest nearby hike and begin navigation for that route and we asked them to identify a wildlife that they observe in their Biology Class. One key difference though was that we aimed to provide a bit less guidance than we did in the first test by encouraging the user to think a little deeper about some of the questions they had rather than answering every question about functionality and what different buttons did. 

#### Issues Overview Negative

## Usability Test 3

### Task 1: Find a hike with a 5 star rating and leave a rating

### Description

The participant for our third usability test was a junior attending Williams College. This time around the participant was an expert at hiking with them frequently going on short hikes alone and longer hikes as part of WOC. Like the other tests, this was performed in Eco Café during the evening when the area was not being utilized by many students. For this test, we wanted to emphasize finding possible ways in which our design may not be intuitive for people who have experience hiking. As our design team does not consist of hiking experts, we thought it would be important to see if both the navigation and wildlife identification aspects of hikAR were intuitive for a frequent hiker. For this particular test, we had Eric take the lead on guiding the user while Rudy moved the pieces of the paper prototype around and Gaurnett took notes on what he observed.
 
Considering the success we had with offering little information to the user as they worked through their assigned tasks, we implemented the same game plan for this test as we did for our second usability test. We explained a bit about our project and how the user’s help would be critical to improving our design as a whole before explaining the two tasks that we wanted them to achieve. This time we asked our user to navigate to a hike based on our recommendation system. We asked them to pick a hike that was rated 5 stars and identify an animal that is running around at the school.

#### Issues Overview Negative

| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Recognition | We asked our user to pick a hike that was rated 5 stars but there was none nearby that matched his skill level. It seemed as if most of the 5 star rated ones were beginner hikes and they were not ones that will match his recommendations. | 2 | Rather than forcing users to scroll down the list of nearby trails to find one that matches their preferences, we revised our design to include an option that allows the user to filter routes by difficulty to allow users to quickly find routes that meet their preferences |
| Error Prevention | It was pretty hard to identify the animal because it was moving. To get a good picture of the animal, the user will have to hope that it stops moving so that the perfect shot can be captured | 4 | Another revision that came up was the scaling of the identification camera focal point. For object that are larger than the focal square, it would be more efficient if the user can expand the focal point in order to capture the right image of the object they are trying to find. This will allow them to capture bigger pictures and thus get more out of their experience. |

#### Revision 1

![First revision for third usability test](/img/test3_rev1.jpeg)

We have added a filter function so that users who didn't realize you can scroll/don't want to can find hikes with this instead. 

#### Revision 2

![Second revision for third usability test](/img/test3_rev2.jpeg)

We have changed our camera taking function so that there are 3 different focal sizes for image taking. This way, it will be easier for users to take images from more distances. Also, while not on the paper, if a user double taps the focal area, a picture will be taken. 

#### Issues Overview Positive

| The user liked that we had a recommendation system based on the hiking experience of other users. This will help other users to get a better sense of what is around them. |

## Refinemnet Retrospective

When we refined our process we took what we found unclear during our previous usability tests and changed it so that it would correctly represent what we want our participants to do. For example at first we asked out participant to start a navigation without being too specific. We switched this method up in our tests afterwards so that things are more clear. For example we asked them to start a navigation to a specific hike, a hike that's nearby them or a hike that's rated a specific way. 

In terms of design refinement, we made our changes based on feedback and observations we saw during our testing. For example we forgot a sign up button so we decided to add one, we changed the icon so that it is more clear what it represents and we changed a few word choices and functionalty limitations tha we observed during testing.

# Final Prototype Overview

![Overview of all the pieces of our paper prototype including the revisions](/img/final_overview.jpeg)

The two primary tasks were identification and navigation. However, for each test that we did, these tasks were specified so that we could get more specific results. So for identification, we would ask the user to identifiy something specific to see if they could get it done. This was the same for navigation. The critical aspects of our design would be the error messages and prevention mechanisms implemented to ensure that the user gets the results they want when they want it. We also ensured that all the text and icons were correctly representing what they were intended to do.

# Digital Mockup

## Overview

![Prototype Overview](/img/Mockupoverview.png)

Our digital mockup was created in Balsamiq and is largely consistent with our final paper prototype. Some minor changes were made though as a result of seeing our design in digital form. One decision that we made was to add a scrollbar on the wildlife information page as seeing our design in a slightly higher fidelity caused us to realize that the user would likely need to scroll down for the more comprehensive biographies. Another change made was to move the rating given to each hike to the top of their pictures as this made the most sense space-wise. We also decided to adjust the identification icon to have the tree inside of the magnifying glass rather than outside. All other elements of our paper prototype were able to smoothly transition to digital form.

### Task 1: Trail Navigation

![Prototype Overview](/img/Mockup1.png)

After logging in, the user finds themselves at the homescreen, where they can either find trails using the search bar or a combination of the filtering option and nearby trail options. Once the user has selected a trail, they will be brought to the trail info screen where they can see varying key information about the trail. At this point, the user can return to the home screen using the X in the top left corner, or begin navigation by clicking “START NAVIGATION”. Now, let’s say the user has found the trail they are going to hike and begins navigation. From the navigation screen, they can stop navigation by pressing the X again in the top left corner or hike the trail with the guided system until it is over. After the user finishes the hike or quits navigation, a popup screen asking for the user to leave a review will show up. From there the user can either decide to review the hike or not. 

### Task 2: Identifying wildlife

![Prototype Overview](/img/Mockup2.png)

Our user can start this task at any point before, during, or after their hike. However, let’s assume the user starts from the home screen. To begin identification, the user would click on the identification button at the bottom of their screen. The user would then be taken to the camera where they can adjust the size of the camera focus box using a slider. This allows them to take more precise pictures of large objects like trees or wildlife that might be on the move. When their object is within the frame, they can either press the “Identify This” button or tap their screen twice as a slightly faster and more convenient option.  That action brings up a small pop-up informing the user that the app is now checking the quality of the image to ensure accurate identification. If the picture is blurry, the pop-up changes to ask the user to take a better picture. Otherwise, the user receives a pop-up stating that their attempt has succeeded and is given a button to go to the biography of the given object. At any point throughout this process, the user can click on the X button in the upper-left corner to return back to home screen or navigation screen depending on whether active navigation was occurring when the identification button was pressed.
