### Guiding Principles
- Listening to each other 
- Taking into account everyoneâ€™s ideas 
- Mutual respect 
- Staying productive and focused 
- Being understanding  

### Purpose
- Learn from our project process 
- Ultimate goal: to create a platform to help educate outdoor enthusiasts about their surroundings in the wild   

### Group Roles
- Shared roles: if something needs to get done, divide the workload or volunteer  

### Division of Labor 
- We will try to divide work up evenly among the group
- If someone is more suited for a task, they will likely be called to work or at least help in that portion of the project 
- If group members are too busy during a certain time, more work can be given to the other members - with the expectation that that person will help out others when they are busy  

### Team Plan
- Come together and discuss availability, other course workload
- Look at assignment(s) and decide what roles/work fit best 
- Delegate work, write out what each person is doing either in a document or through online messenger 
- Hold each other accountable and have check-ins at least a day before the project is due  

### Meeting Management 
- We plan to meet every Tuesday from 4-5pm
- The meeting focus will be decided prior to each meeting
- Conflicts resolution/decision making will be done through extensive discussion and voting    

### Accountability 
- We will be responsible for each others progress through in person and online communication
- There will be shared access to a google drive and group repository to verify actions
- If necessary, we will decide as a group on specific checkpoints for larger assignments   

### Rewards and Punishments 
- No punishments  

### Follow up
- If issues are brought up, we will discuss it and decide together if changes need to be made
