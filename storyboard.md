## Rational for choosing a design focus

We chose the design of a mobile app because after doing more research through speaking to friends we found that most students preferred to carry around and use their mobile devices to complete the tasks. They feel as if it is hardware that everyone has, and if we were to choose another design such as a smartwatch or AR glasses then it would require them to buy additional hardware/equipment as opposed to just installing an application on their mobile device. We chose the tasks of navigation and identification because we believe that it is the task that is most needed and would be most used by our customers. When we define the problems that people have while hiking and exploring the wild, we realized that most of the problems come from navigation (getting lost, choosing the right hikes based on experience and the best routes to get to somewhere based on location) and identification (finding edible food while out in the wild and identifying nature that one might be interested in). This design is better suited to the people we are targeting because most people in today’s age have smartphones. This makes it easy to reach and engage our audiences to ensure that they receive the best experience possible. It is also very portable. It is a device that slips right in the pocket and can be taken around anywhere. It is also something that people bring when they are out on hikes or adventures in the wild. Since they already bring their phones out in nature, it would not be a hindrance for them to download our app, adding an additional tool to their hiking, camping or explorationary experience. These tasks are more compelling than others because it is the tasks that are most done by hikers and campers. Every hiker/camper has to navigate to some place. In order to do this they have to find a route from start to finish to get to where they want to be. Most often they get lost while out in the wild or just don’t select the right route based on their skill level. This task is therefore one of utmost importance that is done by all hikers/campers. Identification is also a task that is very important. This is mostly because when people are out camping and they want to find food, they need to be safe when picking what to eat because a wrong decision could be fatal. Hikers need to therefore identify what they are eating properly to avoid this from happening. Nature enthusiasts are also saved the trouble of identifying features of the things they see to precise detail. Instead of counting the number of petals, guessing the right colours or feeling the right texture, they simply need to point, scan and the result they want will appear right at their fingertips. This task is a vital one and has many aspects which is why we believe it is more compelling than others. 

## Navigation

Jordan loves to explore. It’s a good day outside so she wants to go out for a hike. Curious about where she can go, she opens up the hikAR app and looks for new local routes. She then picks a hike based on her hiking level and desired distance. The app gives her a checklist of what to bring and she heads over to the trail. Throughout the hike, she uses the app to guide her and stay on the route. Because of hikAR, Jordan was able to have a fun and easy experience hiking outdoors, not having to worry about getting lost or under-preparing. 

## Identification

Markus is out in the wild by himself because he is curious about the forest nearby his waterfront house in Michigan. He walks by a tree on one of his daily hikes to find out more information about the forest around him. He takes out his phone and logs into the hikAR app. By taking a picture of the tree, he is easily able to identify the type of tree it is and a couple fun facts about the tree. Later on his hike he begins to feel a bit hungry. He goes out exploring berries nearby (or at least things that look like berries). He uses the hikAR app to confirm that the things he found are indeed berries and that they are edible. After getting the confirmation he is able to enjoy his lovely treat and resume his hike.
