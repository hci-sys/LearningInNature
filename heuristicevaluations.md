| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 6 | Navigate/identify simple but ambigous | 1 |
| 3 | Back button is ambiguous, there is no clear way to return to previous view | 4 |
| 1 | Current screen. Some identification of what the current screen is (i.e. route vs identification) | 3 |
| 1 | Wrong identification/Identification Error. Needs to list the chance that the identification is false | 3 |
| 10/6 | Design's ambiguity makes it difficult to figure out where you are in the view | 2 |
| 4 | Search icon is inconsistent with what you're doing (taking a photo) | 2 |
| 5 | User presses navigation button when already in navigation mode and nothing happens | 2 |

## Heuristic Revisions 

Most of the revisions that needed to be made was based on the navigation around the app. There was no back button integrated and this caused navigating back from the current screen difficult to do. Another issue came from the icons. The identification icon was a bit ambiguous so we redesigned it to make it look better and more direct. We had also improved the search functionality to include error messages and a square to properly focus what is being identified on the app. Lastly, we updated the navigation view to include the current status of where our hiker currently is relative to their endpoint.
