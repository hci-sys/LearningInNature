# Cognitive Walk-through
## Issues Overview 
| Issue | Description | Severity |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Visibility | Image/Identification Quality Not Clear | 3 |
| Conceptual Model | Unclear action to verify image/identification quality | 3 |
| Labeling/Signifiers | Retaking image option not visible/unclear | 2 |
| Labeling/Signifiers | Start button for navigation is unclear (just says "start") | 2 | 
| Visibility | Stopping Navigation has no error message | 3 | 

### Issue 1
Step: Check to see if the plant was identified correctly 

### Issue 2 
Step: Check to see if the plant was identified correctly 

### Issue 3
Step: Take another image of the plant if necessary  

### Issue 4
Step: Verify Trail Details and Begin Navigation 

### Issue 5 
Step: Navigate along the trail

Changed pop-up message + color indicators to having a pop-up message after each picture taken indicating whether or not the user should retake the picture. 

# Usability Test 
## Task 1 Issues Overview 
| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Recognition | No signup button  | 4 |
| Control & Freedom | Wanted to click the nearby trails before searching (need to add screens for that)| 2 |

## Task 2 Issues Overview

| Real World Mapping | Clicked the focal point instead of the "take a picture" button | 2 |

## Test Description  
The participant for our usability test was a sophomore attending Williams College. We chose this participant because she is enthusiastic about hiking and enjoy going on a weekly trip around the beautiful purple valley. With this knowledge, the team figured she would be the perfect candidate to test out our app and to see if our prototype design was somewhat feasible. We conducted our usability test in Eco Cafe, where its central and quiet during after hours. This allowed us and our participant to focus on the task at hand and provide a space to free the mind and provide a clear discussion. During the usability test, Gaurnett was the main one communicating with our customer. Rudy and Eric assisted with making notes about what happened during the test such as the customer feedback and questions during the test, flaws in the design that led to customer to performing the wrong action thus not receiving her desired result and improvements we can make based on the interaction between Gaurnett and the customer. 

We introduced the project by giving a synopsis of the problem that we are trying to solve as well as who we are trying to serve. This allowed us to give a general overview of the project and give the participant an idea of what we are trying to do. Afterwards we explained the scenarios one by one that we would like her to perform. We then observed her as she went through the app and then made notes on issues that came up. One issue was that we did not have a sign up button on the login screen. Another issue we had was when she tried to identify the plant. She tapped the focal box to take the picture instead of tapping the “Identify This” button. 

### Incident One
Sign Up button: This was a negative incident because if the user does not have an account they would not be able to use our app. The severity of this would be a 4

### Incident Two
Clicking the first trail: This was a negative incident. When we asked our participant to search for Stone Hill, her first reaction was to tap the first trail that was present on the screen instead of actually searching for the hike. The severity of this would be a 1.

### Incident Three
Tapping the Focal Point: This was a negative incident. When the participant was trying to take a picture of the plant she wanted to identify, she ended up tapping the focal point instead of the button at the bottom of the screen. We realized that this was perhaps just because she was using a paper prototype why this occurred. On a real device the user would perhaps tap the focal point to focus on the image instead of taking it and then tap the button at the bottom to take the actual picture when they are ready. The severity of this would be a 2.

### Incident Four
Identifying the second plant correctly: this is a positive incident. After learning about the button at the bottom of the screen, the user was able to easily identify another wildlife.

### Incident Five
Navigating through the route effectively: This was a positive incident. After selecting stone hill, our participant was able to navigate through the hike fluently to arrive at her destination.

## Future Plans  
In our future usability tests, we would like to diversify our participants in order to gather data from people with different experience and interest levels with hiking and wildlife identification. This will hopefully lead to us discovering more areas in which we can improve our design as each user will be coming into the usability test with different expectations and needs. We already have two specific subjects in mind who meet these requirements. Since we did not run into many incidents during this usability test, we hope to expand the number of options given to the user in terms of routes, identifiable objects, and the amount of information given about said objects before the tests in order to see if any new issues arise or if the simplicity of our design can be maintained when the user’s choices expand. Furthermore, although we did not give much guidance beyond a description of the task we wanted the user to accomplish and a description of what certain buttons do when asked, we might consider giving even less advice for the second usability test to see how, if at all, that affects the way in which our user navigates throughout our design. With that, we can then find a happy medium for our final usability test.
For subsequent tests, we also plan on swapping roles for who is engaging with the user and who is observing and taking notes. For example, for the next test, we might have Rudy communicating with the user while Gaurnett and Eric take notes so that every member gets an opportunity to conduct a usability test and utilize the techniques that we have read about and discussed in class.
